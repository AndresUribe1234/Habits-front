# Habits-front

Habits-front is the front-end code for a web application that helps users track their habits and provides insights to help them stay motivated. The app is built using the Next.js framework, which is based on JavaScript, and it runs on the front-end.

## Motivation

This project is very important to me because I have been tracking my habits for the last 4 years and it has changed my life. By visualizing my progress, I was able to stay motivated and make positive changes in my daily routines. I wanted to create an app that would help others do the same.

## Features

The app has the following features:

- Habit tracking: Users can create habits and track their progress over time.
- Insights: The app provides insights on users' habits, such as streaks, success rates, and most common habits.
- Motivation: The app displays users' progress in a way that helps them stay motivated and continue developing their habits.
- User accounts: Users can create accounts and save their habits and progress.

## Installation

To install the front-end code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AndresUribe1234/Habits-front.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_URL` environment variable in a config file:
   - Create a file called `config.js` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following line to the file: `export const NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_URL = "http://localhost:8000";` (replace `http://localhost:8000` with the port where you are running your back-end API).
4. Run the app: `npm start`

Note: The app requires a back-end API to work properly. Please refer to the [Habits API](https://github.com/AndresUribe1234/Habits-back) repository for more information.
